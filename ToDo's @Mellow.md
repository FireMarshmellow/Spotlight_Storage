# ToDo's ‚Äì MIMOSA

I just started with github, but you can check out how I have set up your MIMOSA system in docker.

## My current setup:
- 16 led panels with 36 pixels (576 pixels on the rotating tower)
- I found it difficult to see the led‚Äôs when the storage boxes are filled to the top and the boxes can divide into three smaller compartments and that blocks the led‚Äôs too, that‚Äôs the reason for the led panels 
- MIMOSA V4.0 on Docker Server
- WLED on ESP32-C3 ultra tiny
- Changed the "LED of Button" to set the led color to black, to stop the WLED's going back to the before set mode. This simply off's the led's. But the partymode and on fuctions are still there if somebody want's them.


## Good:

- The MIMOSA itself üòâ
- Adding pictures is as easy as it could be. Link and file-upload is perfect, what could be a nice thing, when the pictures from the link-adding feature would download the pictures into the database.
- Settings Page
- Adding parts page
- The website itself looks appealing with the modern design.
- Duplication of existing parts.
- Dark mode is nice
- Search bar and tag search


## Not so good:

- Button symbol‚Äôs (locate, add, remove, edit) don‚Äôt always load, so it is difficult to know what button what is
pic!

- The slider for ‚Äúled show time‚Äù is cool, but this value does not need to be changed that often. My point is: If that was a value box where you can type the number in seconds or minutes, it would be better. When using the smartphone, I found myself accidently sliding this when on the MIMOSA settings page.
- The brightness slider is fine, but as said above, this value does not change that often.
- Sometimes the locate-button does not do anything, like it is bricked and after some while it works, or if not after a hard reboot it works. But I do not know what causes it, could also be my network (not sure).

## Wished feature‚Äôs:

- The Cube I‚Äôve built has four sides, it is possible to use the serpentine, but this is more, or less ideal (576 entries are a lot, in one list). I don‚Äôt know if this is a bit difficult to program, but maybe not. So, a setting for more serpentine‚Äôs that could start with 1 ‚Äì X and then start a new serpentine next to it from 1 ‚Äì X.

- Language file: I currently run my MIMOSA 4.0 as a docker and translated the website-file to German.  But some things can‚Äôt be translated, because then the lines and numbers of the serpentine get mixed up and is not correct anymore. So, a file where the end-user could add the right translation for all text in the website-file that than merges to it, and shows everything in the languages the user has set up.

- Database and folders for pictures in docker
- QR-Code to scan with a Barcode-Scanner, to add or remove Stock (would be nice to have but not required)
- There should be a message box or something asking for stock changes, to reduce the chance of accidently removing or adding stock of parts.
- Settable price in part, that then shows not only the price for that specific part and its stock level, but also the amount of money the organizer currently holds.
- Showing already used pixels in serpentine: if you have free storage containers (especially in such a large environment like mine) you can easily lose track of them. If all used boxes/pixels are shown with the blue-dot, it is easy to find and select free boxes.
- On my pcb layout I did not pay attention to the serpentine. So it would be nice to be able to change the serpentine and number generating not only horizontal and vertical, but also vertical beginning always on the left side.

- The copy option for a part does copy everything except the pictures. That would be nice to have. E.g. I added rasperrypi‚Äôs and just needed to split them in different storage boxes and always needed to recreate the pictures.
- Setting option for pixel colors, to use the full potential of the ws2812 led.
- Settable stock value, if it falls below a set level it indicates low stock with a red color and the user sees that when he pushes the locate button.

### My current workflow to adding parts to my storage tower is as follows:
- Access the server with my smartphone over its ip address.
- Start to add a part with the ‚ÄúAdd Part‚Äù button or copy existing ones.
- Take a picture with the ‚Äúadd from file‚Äù button. On the Smartphone it asks if I want to use a ‚Äúfile from folder‚Äù or use the ‚Äúcamera‚Äù. Usually I just take a picture with the camera in the 1:1 ratio setting to account for bad scaling/cropping/stretching.
- Then select what pixels to use.
- Hit the ‚Äúadd button‚Äù and done.

Let's now assume I want to add screws with the same head and same drive in different lengths. I just copy the added screw with the copy button, there I just need to edit the length, quantity and pixel, but nothing else. So being able to copy parts with the picture would be better.

That would then also account for a part that I have added (e.g. 10 days before), and waited on new stock, but the box the part is in, is already full. Then I just copy that part, change the pixel (storage location) and hit save.
Instead of copying it, take a new picture that is exactly the same and now have 2 pictures of the same on my server and fill up disk space.
